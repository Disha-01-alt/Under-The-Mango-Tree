# Under The Mango Tree – Campus to Career Platform

Under The Mango Tree, a FREE mentorship and placement assistance program for bright students from economically underprivileged backgrounds looking to build a career in the software or AI/ML domain. 

We will evaluate and rate student CVs and projects with industry-grade precision, match their strengths to the right job opportunities, and help them close any skill gaps with targeted training. Our mission is simple: to make every engineering graduate job-ready and in-demand.

To be eligible, you should have done your 10th or 12th from a government school, and should have an EWS certificate. Please do not forget to add these details on our job portal while creating your profile! And note that this service is only for final year students and recent graduates.

On the UTMT portal, you can also find a curated list of videos for various courses relevant for placements in software and AI/ML field. And we are also planning to soon start free weekend sessions on communication skills, since thats a major lacuna for students from such backgrounds.
